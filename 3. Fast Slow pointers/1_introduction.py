# When to use: The Fast & Slow pointer approach, also known as the Hare & Tortoise algorithm, is a pointer algorithm that uses two pointers which move through the array (or sequence/LinkedList) at different speeds. This approach is quite useful when dealing with cyclic LinkedLists or arrays.

# By moving at different speeds (say, in a cyclic LinkedList), the algorithm proves that the two pointers are bound to meet. The fast pointer should catch the slow pointer once both the pointers are in a cyclic loop.

# Example Problem: Given the head of a Singly LinkedList, write a function to determine if the LinkedList has a cycle in it or not.

# # Solution: Letâ€™s analyze these scenarios, considering the fast pointer always moves first:

# If the fast pointer is one step behind the slow pointer: The fast pointer moves two steps and the slow pointer moves one step, and they both meet.
# If the fast pointer is two steps behind the slow pointer: The fast pointer moves two steps and the slow pointer moves one step. After the moves, the fast pointer will be one step behind the slow pointer, which reduces this scenario to the first scenario. This means that the two pointers will meet in the next iteration.
# This concludes that the two pointers will definitely meet if the LinkedList has a cycle.
